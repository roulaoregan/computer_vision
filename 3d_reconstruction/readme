Goal: Recovering the 3D world from 2D images tio build a high-quality 3D model of an object

Uses structured light scanning for object reconstruction

Problems to be solved:
– Mesh cleanup and smoothing
– Mesh alignment
– Combining meshes into a final model
– Rendering final model and adding color

Note:
- two open source files used: 
harris.m (for Harris Corner Detection)
nonmaxsuppts.m (for Non maxima suppression and thresholding for points generated by a feature or corner detector.)
