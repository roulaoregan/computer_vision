Goal: Recovering the 3D world from 2D images tio build a high-quality 3D model of an object

Uses structured light scanning for object reconstruction

Problems to be solved:
– Mesh cleanup and smoothing
– Mesh alignment
– Combining meshes into a final model
– Rendering final model and adding color

Note:
- two open source files used: 
harris.m (for Harris Corner Detection)
nonmaxsuppts.m (for Non maxima suppression and thresholding for points generated by a feature or corner detector.)



The main driver files are:
Phase 1 - given 2d data and generate data
- run "reconstruct.m". Input are two series of photos taken of a object with a structured light projected ontop of it. Output all the scan data to generate a 3D object.
Phase 2 - clean up data
-"meshBuild.m" mesh cleaning and smoothin. Output data of all the variables needed to stitch a build a mesh
Phase 3 - 3D reconstruction
- Final Results of surface is stitched together using "Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction":
http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon/Version8.0/
- _FINAL_RESULTS.m takes the data generated by PoissonRecon and plots data in 3D
