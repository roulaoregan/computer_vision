Goal: Recovering the 3D world from 2D images to build a high-quality 3D model of an object

Uses structured light scanning for object reconstruction

Problems to be solved:
– Mesh cleanup and smoothing
– Mesh alignment
– Combining meshes into a final model
– Rendering final model and adding color

Note: two open source files used: 
- harris.m (for Harris Corner Detection)
- nonmaxsuppts.m (for Non maxima suppression and thresholding for points generated by a feature or corner detector.)

Object Reconstruction Pipeline:
-------------------------------
Step 1 - collect 2d data and out all the scanned data to a MATLAB .mat file
Collected the data by taking a series of photos of the object of different angles – front, back, right and left, for a complete 360 degree view of the object. I used the Structured light process and projected a gray code image.
- "decode.m" function decodes the gray code in MATLAB, reads in a set of images captured by the camera.
- "reconstruct.m". Input are two series of photos taken of a object with a structured light projected ontop of it. Output all the scan data to generate a 3D object.

Step 2 - building the mesh, including cleaning and smoothing
- "meshBuild.m" file generates a mesh per image. Output data of all the variables needed to stitch a build a mesh
- cleaning includes three steps, first, remove points outside known bounding box; second,  remove points whose neighbors are further away then a given threshold; and lastly, removing triangles which have long edges. These algorithms are:
- "nbr.error.m"
-	"nbr_smooth.m"
- "tri_error.m"
- mesh alignment algorithm combined the Rigid body alignment and the SVD  with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to measure how far the 3D recovered location of a point is from its neighbor and followed the algorithm:
	1.	Estimate corresponding points.
	2.	Align by computing R,T which brings the matching points closest together; minimize the mean squared error.
	3.	Repeat until convergence.

Step 3 - reconstructed surfaces using the Poisson Surface Reconstruction software to combine the meshes together.
- Final Results of surface is stitched together using "Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction":
http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon/Version8.0/
- _FINAL_RESULTS.m takes the data generated by PoissonRecon and plots data in 3D
